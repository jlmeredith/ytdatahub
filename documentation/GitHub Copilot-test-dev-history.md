I understand this is a concerning issue - having your test code reduced from 2000+ lines to just 921 lines represents a significant loss of test coverage. Let me help you fix this by investigating what happened and restoring the missing tests.

First, let me check if there are any backup versions of this file or if we can find evidence of what happened.

I see the search results and no backups of your test file were found. Let's check if Git has any history of this file that might help us understand what happened and recover the missing content.

I've checked for backup files and tried to examine the Git history of your test file, but it seems there's no Git history available for this file. This suggests either the file is newly created and hasn't been committed yet, or there might be issues with the Git repository.

Let's try a few more approaches to recover your missing test code. First, let's see if there are any other test files that might contain similar or related tests:

I see that your test class appears only in the one test file we've already examined, with no other occurrences elsewhere in the codebase.

Let me look for any other versions of the test file that might exist in temporary files or with different extensions:

It seems my search for alternate versions of your test file didn't return any results. Let's try another approach to investigate and recover your missing test code.

Let's search for test method names from the test file to see if they might have been moved to other files:

After investigating your test file issue, I've found that there are no backup versions or alternative copies of your test file in the repository. The Git history doesn't show previous versions of the file, which suggests it might be newly created or there could be issues with the Git repository.

I searched for related files and other instances of your test class, but everything points to the single file we already examined. The test methods, like test_sequential_delta_updates, also only appear in this one file.

Looking at the evidence, there are several possibilities for what happened:

The file was truncated during an edit or save operation
The file was never as large as you remembered
The file content exists elsewhere in a different location
There was a version control issue where content was lost
Given that we haven't found any backups or alternate versions, we have a few options to address this:

We could restore from a recent backup if you have one (Time Machine, cloud backup, etc.)
We could reconstruct the missing tests based on your knowledge of what they contained
We could look for code snippets in other files that might have been part of the original tests
Let me help you recreate the missing tests. The file ends abruptly with:

The test is clearly incomplete. Let's complete this test and add any others that you remember were in the file. Do you have any specific tests you remember that were in the file but are now missing? Or would you like me to suggest some additional tests that would complement your existing test suite?
