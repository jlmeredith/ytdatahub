   - Update API documentation to match implementation
   - Create clear database documentation

## Content Guidelines

1. **Be Concise**: Focus on clarity over verbosity
2. **Use Examples**: Include practical examples wherever possible
3. **Visual Support**: Use screenshots, diagrams, and charts
4. **Active Voice**: Write in active voice for clarity
5. **User Perspective**: Present information from the user's point of view
6. **Avoid Development History**: Focus on current functionality, not how it was developed
7. **Link Related Content**: Create clear navigation paths between related documents

## Maintenance Plan

1. **Documentation Reviews**: Schedule regular reviews to ensure accuracy
