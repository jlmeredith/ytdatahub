# YTDataHub Test Suite Coverage

YTDataHub includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure functionality and reliability. This document provides an overview of the test coverage, organization, and execution procedures.

## Test Organization

Tests are organized into the following categories:

- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Testing interactions between components
- **UI Tests**: Testing user interface components and interactions
- **Fixtures**: Reusable test data and setup configurations

## Core Test Coverage

### Utility Tests

- **Helper Functions** (`test_helpers.py`): Tests for formatting functions (numbers, durations), time conversions, quota usage estimation, and debug logging.
- **Queue Management** (`test_helpers.py`): Tests for background task queuing system and worker thread management.
- **YouTubeTestFactory** (`youtube_test_factory.py`): Tests for verification of step sequences in data collection workflows.

### Database Tests

- **SQLite Operations** (`test_sqlite.py`): Tests for database operations, including temporary database creation and cleanup.
- **Database Integration** (`test_database_integration.py`): Tests for API-to-database workflows, connection handling, and data integrity.

### UI Tests

- **Tab Navigation** (`test_tab_navigation.py`): Tests for tab styling, rendering, and theme-specific styling (light/dark mode).
- **Channel Selection** (`test_channel_selection.py`): Tests for channel selection workflow and data loading.
- **Debug Panel** (`test_debug_panel.py`): Tests for session state maintenance and debug panel visualization.
- **Channel Refresh** (`test_channel_refresh_ui.py`): Tests for refreshing channel data in the UI.
- **API Data Display** (`test_api_data_display.py`): Tests for displaying API data in the UI.

### Integration Tests

- **Data Collection Workflow** (`test_data_collection_workflow.py`): End-to-end tests of the data collection process from API to storage.
- **Sequential Delta Updates** (`test_sequential_delta_updates.py`): Tests for incremental data updates and delta reporting.

## Missing Test Coverage

While the test suite provides good coverage of many components, some areas could benefit from additional testing:

1. **Analytics Components**: Limited tests for data visualization and analysis features.
2. **Error Handling**: Edge cases and error recovery scenarios need more comprehensive tests.
3. **Performance Tests**: No specific tests for performance under load or with large datasets.
4. **End-to-End Tests**: Limited full workflow tests from UI interaction through to database storage.
5. **Storage Providers**: Tests focus primarily on SQLite, with less coverage of other storage options.

## Running Tests

To run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test category
pytest tests/unit/

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=src
```

For development testing with debug output:

```python
# Enable debug logging in tests
st.session_state.debug_mode = True
st.session_state.log_level = logging.DEBUG
```

## Test-Driven Development

When adding new features to YTDataHub, we recommend following test-driven development principles:

1. Write a test that defines the expected behavior
2. Verify that the test fails (since the feature doesn't exist yet)
3. Implement the feature
4. Verify that the test passes
5. Refactor as needed while ensuring tests continue to pass

## Test Data

The test suite includes fixtures for generating test data:

- Sample channel data
- Video metadata and statistics
- Comment threads with replies
- Mock API responses

These fixtures allow tests to run without requiring actual API connections, making the test suite faster and more reliable.

## Contributing to Tests

When contributing to the YTDataHub project, please ensure that you:

1. Add tests for any new functionality
2. Update existing tests when changing behavior
3. Verify that all tests pass before submitting pull requests
