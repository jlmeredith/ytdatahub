# Comment Collection Scenarios

This document provides guidance on different comment collection scenarios in YTDataHub, depending on your data analysis needs.

## 1. Lightweight Collection (Focus on Top-Level Comments Only)

Ideal for: Quick sentiment analysis, overview of audience reception, minimal API quota usage

```python
# Lightweight collection
options = {
    'fetch_comments': True,
    'max_comments_per_video': 10,   # Small number of top comments
    'max_replies_per_comment': 0    # No replies
}
youtube_service.collect_channel_data(channel_input, options)
```

**Benefits:**
- Lowest API quota usage
- Fastest collection time
- Covers primary audience sentiment

**Limitations:**
- Misses context provided by replies
- May not represent full conversation threads
- Limited for engagement analysis

**Estimated API calls:** 1 call per video + 1 for channel data

## 2. Balanced Collection (Top Comments + Limited Replies)

Ideal for: General content analysis, moderate engagement studies, balanced quota usage

```python
# Balanced collection
options = {
    'fetch_comments': True,
    'max_comments_per_video': 25,   # Moderate number of top comments
    'max_replies_per_comment': 5    # Limited replies per comment
}
youtube_service.collect_channel_data(channel_input, options)
```

**Benefits:**
- Provides conversation context
- Good balance of breadth and depth
- Suitable for most analysis needs

**Limitations:**
- May miss some deep conversation threads
- Moderate API quota usage

**Estimated API calls:** 1-3 calls per video + 1 for channel data

## 3. Comprehensive Collection (Maximum Data)

Ideal for: In-depth audience engagement analysis, community studies, research projects

```python
# Comprehensive collection
options = {
    'fetch_comments': True,
    'max_comments_per_video': 100,   # Maximum top comments
    'max_replies_per_comment': 20    # Many replies per comment
}
youtube_service.collect_channel_data(channel_input, options)
```

**Benefits:**
- Most complete conversation data
- Captures full engagement context 
- Best for comprehensive analysis

**Limitations:**
- Highest API quota usage
- Longest collection time
- May collect more data than needed for basic analysis

**Estimated API calls:** 3+ calls per video + 1 for channel data

## Making the Right Choice

Consider these factors when deciding which collection scenario to use:

1. **Analysis Purpose**: What insights are you trying to gain? Surface-level sentiment needs less data than deep engagement analysis.

2. **Channel Size**: For channels with many videos, start with lightweight collection and then use more comprehensive options for selected videos.

3. **API Quota**: If you have limited quota, prioritize a smaller number of videos with balanced collection rather than many videos with lightweight collection.

4. **Video Type**: For videos where conversation is important (debates, tutorials, controversial topics), prefer balanced or comprehensive collection.

## Testing Your Configuration

Use the provided `examples/comment_collection_example.py` script to test different configurations:

```bash
python examples/comment_collection_example.py --api-key YOUR_API_KEY --channel "@channelname" \
    --max-comments 20 --max-replies 5 --max-videos 2
```

This will show you exactly what data each configuration collects and help you make an informed decision.
