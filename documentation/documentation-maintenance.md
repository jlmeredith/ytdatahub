# Documentation Maintenance Guide

This guide outlines the recommended process for maintaining and updating the YTDataHub documentation as the application evolves.

## Documentation Philosophy

The YTDataHub documentation should:

1. **Be user-centered**: Focus on helping users understand and use the application
2. **Be accurate**: Correctly reflect the current state of the application
3. **Be concise**: Provide clear information without unnecessary details
4. **Be well-organized**: Make it easy to find relevant information
5. **Be comprehensive**: Cover all significant aspects of the application

## When to Update Documentation

Documentation should be updated in the following situations:

- When adding new features to the application
- When changing how existing features work
- When removing features
- When refactoring code that affects user experience
- When clarification is needed based on user feedback

## What to Update

1. **README.md**: Update when major features are added or changed
2. **Feature documentation**: Update when specific features are modified
3. **Screenshots**: Update when UI changes significantly
4. **Technical documentation**: Update when architecture or implementation changes
5. **CHANGELOG.md**: Update with each significant release or change

## How to Update Documentation

### For Feature Changes

1. Identify all documentation that mentions the feature
2. Update feature descriptions to reflect current functionality
3. Update screenshots if the UI has changed
4. Update examples to use current syntax or workflows

### For New Features

1. Add feature description to appropriate documentation files
2. Add the feature to README.md if it's significant
3. Create dedicated documentation if the feature is complex
4. Add screenshots or diagrams as needed
5. Add the feature to CHANGELOG.md

### For Deprecated Features

1. Mark the feature as deprecated in all relevant documentation
2. Explain alternative approaches where appropriate
3. Note the deprecation in CHANGELOG.md

## Documentation Standards

### Writing Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Write in active voice
- Use consistent terminology
- Include examples for complex concepts
- Focus on what users can do, not implementation details

### Formatting

- Use proper Markdown formatting
- Maintain consistent heading levels
- Use code blocks for code examples
- Use bullet points for lists of items
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps

### Screenshots

- Capture the entire relevant UI
- Use annotations to highlight important elements
- Ensure screenshots reflect current UI
- Provide descriptive captions
- Use consistent resolution and aspect ratio

## Review Process

Before committing documentation changes:

1. Check for accuracy against the current application
2. Verify that all links work correctly
3. Ensure formatting is consistent
4. Check spelling and grammar
5. Verify that examples still work

## Documentation Organization

Maintain the established documentation structure:

- **README.md**: Application overview and quick start
- **documentation/index.md**: Central documentation hub
- **Feature documentation**: Detailed guides for each major feature
- **Technical documentation**: Architecture and implementation details
- **CHANGELOG.md**: History of significant changes
