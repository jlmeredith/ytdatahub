# Multi-Playlist Selection Feature - Testing Guide

## 🎉 Feature Complete! 

The new channel workflow's Step 2 has been successfully upgraded from single-playlist (uploads only) to multi-playlist selection.

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **New API Methods**
- `VideoClient.get_channel_playlists()` - Fetches all playlists for a channel
- `YouTubeAPI.get_channel_playlists()` - Main API layer integration  
- `YouTubeService.get_channel_playlists()` - Service layer integration

### 2. **Enhanced UI Workflow**
- **Step 2** completely rewritten for multi-playlist selection
- Grid layout with checkboxes for each playlist
- Auto-selection of uploads playlist by default
- Detailed playlist information display (video count, privacy, description)
- Batch playlist saving operations

### 3. **Key Features**
- **Multi-Selection**: Choose multiple playlists from a channel
- **Smart Defaults**: Uploads playlist automatically selected
- **Rich Display**: Shows playlist details, video counts, privacy status
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of channels with no playlists
- **Session Management**: Maintains selections across UI interactions

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### **Step 1: Access New Channel Workflow**
1. Open the application at http://localhost:8501
2. Navigate to **Data Collection** in the sidebar
3. Select **New Channel Collection**

### **Step 2: Test Channel Input** 
1. Enter a YouTube channel URL or ID (try channels with multiple playlists)
2. Recommended test channels:
   - `@GoogleDevelopers` - Has multiple public playlists
   - `@YouTube` - Official YouTube channel with many playlists
   - `UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw` - Google Developers channel ID

### **Step 3: Verify Step 1 (Channel Info)**
1. Confirm channel information loads correctly
2. Click **"Continue to Playlists"**

### **Step 4: Test Multi-Playlist Selection**
1. **Verify Display**: Should show grid of available playlists
2. **Check Auto-Selection**: Uploads playlist should be pre-selected
3. **Test Selection**: Check/uncheck different playlists
4. **Review Details**: Each playlist shows:
   - Video count
   - Privacy status
   - Description preview
   - Publish date

### **Step 5: Test Playlist Saving**
1. Select multiple playlists
2. Click **"💾 Save Selected Playlists"**
3. Verify success message
4. Click **"▶️ Continue to Videos"**

### **Edge Cases to Test**

#### **No Playlists Scenario**
- Test with a channel that has no public playlists
- Should show message: "No public playlists found"
- Should allow skipping to videos step

#### **Single Playlist Scenario**  
- Test with channel having only uploads playlist
- Should still show in grid format with checkbox

#### **Large Playlist Count**
- Test with channels having many playlists
- Verify pagination/scrolling works properly

#### **Error Scenarios**
