## Project Structure

YTDataHub follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns between data collection, storage, and analysis components. The project is organized into logical modules that handle specific aspects of functionality:

- **Core Application**: Main entry points and configuration
- **Analysis Layer**: Data processing and visualization components
- **Data Access**: API clients and database operations
- **User Interface**: UI components and interaction handlers
  - Modern Components: Current implementation in specialized directories
  - Legacy Components: Original implementation maintained for backward compatibility
- **Utilities**: Helper functions and background task management
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and references

## Recent Architectural Improvements

The codebase has undergone significant refactoring to improve maintainability:

- **Consolidated Utilities**: Merged redundant functionality into unified modules
- **UI Modernization**: Clear separation between legacy and current UI components
- **Centralized Services**: Dedicated services for error handling and quota management
- **Optimized Imports**: Reduced memory usage with lazy loading patterns
