## Next Steps

Based on the [Refactor & Cleanup TODOs](refactor_todo.md), the next priorities are:

### 8. Remove or Clearly Mark Deprecated/Transitional Modules (Continued)
- Complete updating remaining test files (marked in documentation)
- Plan for removal in next major version

### 9. Update Documentation to Reflect Refactored Codebase
- Update all relevant documentation after each major refactor
- Ensure diagrams, tables, and cross-references are accurate

## Implementation Notes

Throughout the refactoring process, we've maintained:

1. **Backward compatibility** - Ensuring existing functionality continues to work
2. **Test integrity** - Avoiding breaking existing tests
3. **Documentation updates** - Keeping documentation in sync with code changes
4. **Code clarity** - Improving readability and reducing cognitive load

Future refactoring efforts should continue to follow these principles to ensure the codebase remains maintainable and robust.
