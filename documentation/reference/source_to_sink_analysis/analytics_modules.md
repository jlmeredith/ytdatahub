## Optimization Notes

Recent optimizations have improved the performance and maintainability of the analytics modules:

### Import Optimization

- **Lazy NumPy Imports**: The NumPy library is now imported only when needed inside functions, rather than at the module level
- **Conditional Statistical Imports**: Libraries like statsmodels are imported conditionally with graceful fallbacks
- **Reduced Memory Footprint**: This lazy loading approach reduces memory usage when analytics functions aren't being used

### Performance Improvements

- **Caching Strategy**: Analytics results are cached using Streamlit's session state
- **Optimized DataFrame Operations**: Minimized unnecessary dataframe copies and transformations
- **Conditional Computation**: Heavy calculations are only performed when data has changed

These optimizations maintain full functionality while reducing resource usage, particularly for users with lower-end hardware.
