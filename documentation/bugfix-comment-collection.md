# Comment Collection Fix - Technical Summary

## Issue Description

Two issues were identified in the comment collection feature:

1. The UI in the refresh workflow didn't show options to adjust both top-level comments and replies (unlike the main workflow)
2. The comment collection logic was not correctly enforcing the limit on the number of comments to collect per video

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. UI Improvements

- Added two sliders to the refresh workflow UI:
  - "Top-Level Comments Per Video" (0-100)
  - "Replies Per Top-Level Comment" (0-50)
- Added explanatory captions to each slider
- Ensured both parameters are passed to the API client

### 2. Comment Collection Logic Fixes

- Modified how top-level comments are counted and tracked:
  - Now properly accounting for existing comments when determining how many to fetch
  - Added a distinction between total comments and top-level comments
  - Improved detection of when the limit is reached
- Added a safety check to ensure we don't exceed the requested limit
- Added proper handling for videos that already have comments
- Added better debug logging for tracking and diagnostics

### 3. Additional Enhancements

- Created a verification tool (`tools/verify_comment_limits.py`) to check comment limits
- Added detailed logging of reply statistics
- Improved debug messages for easier troubleshooting

## Validation Steps

To validate the fix:

1. Run the application and try collecting comments with different limits
2. Check that the number of top-level comments does not exceed the specified limit
3. Check that the number of replies per comment does not exceed the specified limit
4. Run the verification tool to check database consistency

## Technical Notes

The issue occurred because the code was counting total comments (including replies) rather than just top-level comments when determining if the limit had been reached. This resulted in more comments being collected than requested.

The fix properly separates the tracking of top-level comments from replies and ensures both limits are enforced independently.
