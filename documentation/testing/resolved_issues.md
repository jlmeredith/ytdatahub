## Recently Resolved Issues

### Video Pagination in YouTube Service

We fixed the pagination issue in the video collection service:

1. **Description of Issue**:

   - The `test_video_pagination` test was failing because only the first 50 videos were being collected
   - The code was not properly handling pagination tokens from the YouTube API
   - Expected behavior was to collect all 150 videos across 3 pages of results

2. **Files Modified**:

   - `/src/services/youtube/video_service.py` - Implemented proper pagination handling

3. **Key Changes**:

   - Refactored `collect_channel_videos` method to use a while loop for pagination
   - Added tracking of `nextPageToken` from each response
   - Implemented proper aggregation of videos from multiple pages
   - Added better logging of page-by-page collection

4. **Results**:

   - Pagination test now passes successfully
   - System correctly collects all videos across multiple pages
   - Integration test pass rate increased from 98% to 100%

5. **Date Fixed**:
   - May 18, 2025

### Method Name Compatibility in Delta Service

We fixed the compatibility issue in the Delta Service:

1. **Description of Issue**:

   - Several tests were looking for `calculate_video_deltas` method but the implementation used `calculate_deltas`
   - This inconsistency caused 8+ tests to fail

2. **Files Modified**:

   - `/src/services/youtube/delta_service.py` - Added smart compatibility function

3. **Key Changes**:

   - Added method that detects parameter types and delegates to appropriate implementation
   - Used function signature inspection to handle different calling patterns
   - Added detailed logging of compatibility method behavior for debugging

4. **Results**:

   - All unit tests in `TestSequentialDeltaUpdates` class now pass
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing code
   - Fixed 8+ failing tests across multiple test classes

5. **Date Fixed**:
   - May 18, 2025

### Error Handling in YouTube Service

We fixed a critical issue with error propagation in the YouTube service implementation:

1. **Description of Issue**:

   - The `test_api_error_during_video_fetch` test was failing because HttpError exceptions were being caught and handled at the service level rather than propagated.
   - This prevented proper error handling in higher layers of the application.

2. **Files Modified**:

   - `/src/services/youtube/video_service.py` - Fixed exception handling to let HttpError propagate
   - `/src/services/youtube/youtube_service_impl.py` - Fixed indentation and error handling flow

3. **Key Changes**:

   - Modified `collect_channel_videos` method in `video_service.py` to re-raise YouTubeAPIError instead of swallowing it
   - Fixed exception handling structure in `youtube_service_impl.py` to properly catch and propagate HttpError
   - Ensured clear error logging when errors occur

4. **Results**:

   - All error handling tests are now passing (28 tests)
   - Integration test suite has improved from 5/50 passing to 103/105 passing

5. **Remaining Issues**:
   - StreamContext warnings remain but are expected when running in test mode
