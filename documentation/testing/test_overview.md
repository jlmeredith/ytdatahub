This document provides an overview of testing in the YTDataHub project.

## Understanding Test Types

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation. In the YTDataHub project, unit tests verify that specific functions, methods, or classes work correctly on their own, without dependencies on other components. For example, testing that the YouTube API client correctly formats requests, or that a database repository properly stores and retrieves data.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different components work together correctly. These tests check that modules interact properly with each other and produce the expected results when combined. For YTDataHub, this includes testing interactions between the API layer and database layer, ensuring data flows correctly through multiple components, and verifying that complex workflows function as expected.

### UI Tests

UI tests focus on the user interface components, ensuring that they render correctly, handle user interactions appropriately, and display the right data. In YTDataHub, these tests verify that UI components like the channel selector, data displays, and interactive elements function as intended within the Streamlit framework.

### Standalone Tests

Standalone tests are special tests that verify critical functionality outside the main test framework. They typically test end-to-end processes or validate specific configurations. In YTDataHub, these include repository tests and simple integration tests that check basic functionality of the whole system.

## Test-Driven Development Overview

Test-Driven Development (TDD) follows a specific workflow:

1. **Write a test** - Before implementing a feature, write a test that defines the expected behavior.
2. **Run the test** - Verify that the test fails (since the feature isn't implemented yet).
3. **Write the code** - Implement the feature to make the test pass.
4. **Run the test again** - Verify that the test now passes.
5. **Refactor** - Clean up the code while ensuring tests still pass.

In YTDataHub:

- Unit tests drive the development of individual components like API clients and repositories.
- Integration tests ensure these components work together correctly.
- UI tests validate that the interface correctly displays data and handles user interactions.
- Failing tests indicate incomplete features or regressions that need to be addressed.

## Guide to Interpreting Test Failures

Understanding what test failures mean is crucial for effective debugging and maintenance:

### Types of Test Failures

1. **Assertion Failures**: The test ran but the actual result didn't match the expected result.

   - **Example**: `AssertionError: Expected 2 videos, found 0`
   - **Approach**: Compare the expected vs. actual results to identify logic issues.

2. **Import Errors**: The test couldn't import necessary modules or dependencies.

   - **Example**: `ImportError: cannot import name 'process_videos' from 'src.ui.bulk_import'`
   - **Approach**: Check for circular imports, missing files, or incorrect package structure.

3. **Attribute Errors**: The test tried to access a method or property that doesn't exist.

   - **Example**: `AttributeError: 'YouTubeService' object has no attribute 'update_channel_data'`
   - **Approach**: Either implement the missing method or update the test to use the correct method name.

4. **Type Errors**: The test encountered unexpected data types.

   - **Example**: `TypeError: calculate_deltas() got an unexpected keyword argument 'include_shorts'`
   - **Approach**: Ensure function signatures in the code match what the tests expect.

5. **Context Errors**: The test requires a context that wasn't provided.
   - **Example**: `RuntimeError: Missing ScriptRunContext`
   - **Approach**: Mock the required context or restructure code to be less dependent on global contexts.

### Fixing Test Issues Strategically

1. **Start with Unit Tests**: Fix issues in the smallest components first before moving to integration tests.

2. **Prioritize Critical Path**: Focus on tests that validate core functionality before edge cases.

3. **Fix One Issue Type at a Time**: Solve all circular imports before moving on to method mismatches.

4. **Create Regression Tests**: When fixing bugs, add tests to prevent them from recurring.

5. **Use Test Fixtures**: Standardize test setup to make tests more reliable and easier to maintain.
