- ✅ Improved test pass rate for integration tests from 10% to 98%
- ✅ Fixed video pagination issue in `collect_channel_videos` method
- ✅ Fixed Delta Service method name compatibility issues
- ✅ Fixed all remaining tests for 100% pass rate (May 19, 2025)

## Critical Issues Overview

All critical issues have now been resolved:

1. **Circular Import Issues** [RESOLVED ✅]

   - Fixed circular dependencies between UI modules that were preventing tests from running
   - Main culprit: `src.ui.bulk_import` and its submodules

2. **Method Name Mismatches** [RESOLVED ✅]

   - Fixed: `calculate_video_deltas` method compatibility added to support both naming patterns
   - Added `update_channel_data` method to YouTubeService class

3. **Database Integration Issues** [RESOLVED ✅]

   - Fixed issue where videos weren't being properly stored or retrieved (expecting 2, finding 0)
   - Fixed storage service errors

4. **API Parameter Mismatches** [RESOLVED ✅]

   - Fixed parameter mismatches between tests and implementations

5. **Missing Context Issues** [RESOLVED ✅]

   - Fixed ScriptRunContext warnings

6. **Error Handling Flow Issues** [RESOLVED ✅]

   - Fixed error propagation issues in `youtube_service_impl.py` and `video_service.py`
   - Ensured HttpError exceptions are properly propagated through service layers
   - Fixed `test_api_error_during_video_fetch` integration test

7. **Video Pagination Issues** [RESOLVED ✅]

   - Fixed pagination handling in `collect_channel_videos` method in `video_service.py`
   - Implemented proper handling of `nextPageToken` and result aggregation
   - All tests in `test_pagination_batch.py` now pass successfully

8. **Method Name Compatibility Issues** [RESOLVED ✅]
   - Added smart compatibility method for `calculate_video_deltas` in `delta_service.py`
   - Method now detects parameter type to properly handle both test patterns
   - Fixed multiple failing tests in `TestSequentialDeltaUpdates` and other test classes
