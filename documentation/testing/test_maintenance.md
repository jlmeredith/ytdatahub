# YTDataHub Test Maintenance

This document provides guidelines for maintaining tests in the YTDataHub project.

## Interpreting Test Failures and Fixing Approaches

### Types of Test Failures

1. **Assertion Failures**

   - **What they mean**: The code is producing a result different from what was expected.
   - **Example**: `assert 0 == 2` in database tests shows videos aren't being stored.
   - **Fixing approach**: Compare the expected vs. actual results, then fix the implementation.

2. **AttributeError**

   - **What they mean**: The code is trying to access a property or method that doesn't exist.
   - **Example**: `AttributeError: 'DeltaService' object has no attribute 'calculate_video_deltas'`
   - **Fixing approach**: Either add the missing method or update the calling code to use the correct name.

3. **Import Errors**

   - **What they mean**: Python can't import a module, usually due to circular imports.
   - **Example**: `ImportError: cannot import name 'render_bulk_import_tab' from partially initialized module`
   - **Fixing approach**: Restructure imports, possibly moving imports to function level or refactoring module dependencies.

4. **Mock Verification Failures**
   - **What they mean**: A mocked method wasn't called as expected during the test.
   - **Example**: `Expected 'store_channel_data' to be called once. Called 0 times.`
   - **Fixing approach**: Either fix the implementation to call the method or update the test's expectations.

### How to Approach Test Fixes

1. **First, understand the test**:

   - What is the test trying to verify?
   - What's the expected behavior?

2. **Identify the failure type**:

   - Is it an assertion failure, attribute error, import error, or something else?

3. **Locate the issue**:

   - In assertion failures: Compare expected vs. actual values
   - In attribute errors: Check if the method/attribute exists or has been renamed
   - In import errors: Examine the import structure for circular dependencies

4. **Fix with the right strategy**:

   - For renamed methods: Either update all references or add the missing method
   - For circular imports: Restructure the import hierarchy or move imports to function level
   - For assertion failures: Fix the implementation to produce the expected results

5. **Run the test again**:
   - Verify the fix resolves the issue without breaking other tests

## Successfully Passing Tests

The following tests are already passing successfully:

1. Video views extraction tests (all 6)
2. Repository basic functionality tests
3. YouTube API initialization and base functionality tests
4. Data helper function tests
5. Debug logging tests
6. All integration tests
7. All UI tests
8. All standalone tests

## Detailed Issue Catalog

All issues have been resolved as of May 19, 2025.

## Prioritized Action Items

### Medium Priority

1. **Document Error Handling Best Practices**

   - Create guidelines for exception handling across the application based on our recent fixes
   - Update developer documentation to include lessons learned from error handling refactor

2. **Address API Parameter Mismatches**

   - Ensure API method tests align with implementation regarding parameters

3. **Add Missing YouTubeService Methods**

   - Implement `update_channel_data` or modify tests to use existing methods

4. **Fix Session State Mocking**
   - Improve Streamlit mocking to properly handle session_state

### Low Priority

1. **Address Streamlit Context Warnings**

   - Fix or suppress ScriptRunContext warnings during tests

2. **Review Test Configurations**
   - Fix "Unknown config option" warnings for timeout and verbose
