This document provides best practices for testing in the YTDataHub project.

## Test Maintenance and TDD Best Practices

Maintaining a healthy test suite is essential for the long-term success of the YTDataHub project. Here are some best practices to follow:

### Maintaining Test Quality

1. **Keep Tests Independent**: Each test should run independently without relying on the state from other tests. This makes debugging easier and prevents cascading failures.

2. **Use Descriptive Test Names**: Test names should clearly describe what they're testing and the expected outcome. For example, `test_video_data_is_correctly_stored_in_database` is better than `test_database_function`.

3. **Test One Thing Per Test**: Each test should verify a single concept. This makes tests easier to understand and debug.

4. **Review Tests During Code Reviews**: Tests should be reviewed with the same scrutiny as production code to ensure they're effective and maintainable.

5. **Regularly Run the Full Test Suite**: Run all tests frequently to catch regressions early.

### Test-Driven Development Best Practices

1. **Write the Minimal Test First**: Start with a simple test that defines the most basic functionality needed.

2. **Make it Fail for the Right Reason**: Ensure your test fails because the functionality isn't implemented, not because of a test error.

3. **Write the Minimal Implementation**: Write just enough code to make the test pass - don't implement extra features until you have tests for them.

4. **Refactor After Tests Pass**: Once your tests pass, clean up your code without changing its behavior.

5. **Use "Red, Green, Refactor" Cycle**:
   - Red: Write a failing test
   - Green: Make the test pass with the simplest code possible
   - Refactor: Clean up the code while keeping tests passing

### YTDataHub-Specific Testing Guidelines

1. **Mock External APIs**: Always mock the YouTube API in tests to avoid hitting real API endpoints and consuming quota.

2. **Use Test Databases**: Use separate in-memory or test databases for testing to avoid corrupting production data.

3. **Handle UI State Carefully**: When testing Streamlit components, ensure proper context initialization and state management.

4. **Test Different Data Scenarios**: Test with various channel sizes, video counts, and edge cases like channels with no videos.

5. **Integration Test Focus Areas**:
   - Data consistency between API and database
   - Correct aggregation of statistics
   - Proper error handling and recovery
   - Complete workflow execution

### Testing Metrics to Track

1. **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by tests (aim for at least 80%)
2. **Test Reliability**: Frequency of flaky tests that sometimes pass and sometimes fail
3. **Test Running Time**: How long tests take to run (aim to keep the suite fast)
4. **Failed Test Ratio**: Percentage of tests that are failing (should decrease over time)
