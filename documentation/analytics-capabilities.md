## Analytics Components

### 1. Analytics Dashboard

The Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of channel performance metrics and trends.

#### Current Capabilities

- **Performance Metrics Visualization**

  - View counts over time with date filtering
  - Like counts and engagement trends
  - Comment activity tracking
  - Video duration analysis

- **Time Series Analysis**

  - Interactive timeline charts with zoom capability
  - Date range selection for focused analysis
  - Seasonal pattern detection

- **Configurable Display**

#### Implementation Details

The dashboard leverages Plotly for interactive visualizations and Streamlit's session state for maintaining chart configuration preferences. Performance data is processed through the analysis layer, which performs calculations on the raw YouTube data.

```python
# Simplified example of how trend analysis is implemented
def generate_trend_line(data, window_size='Medium'):
    window_map = {'Small': 5, 'Medium': 10, 'Large': 20}
    window = window_map.get(window_size, 10)

    # Apply rolling average
    trend = data.rolling(window=window).mean()

    # Calculate growth rate
    growth_rate = ((data.iloc[-1] - data.iloc[0]) / data.iloc[0]) * 100

    return trend, growth_rate
```

### 2. Data Coverage Analysis

The Data Coverage component visualizes the completeness of collected data and provides recommendations for further data collection.

#### Current Capabilities

- **Visual Coverage Indicators**

  - Color-coded bar charts showing data completeness percentages
  - Video coverage visualization (collected vs. total available)
  - Comment coverage visualization (videos with comments vs. total videos)
  - Data distribution heatmaps

- **Temporal Distribution**

  - Stacked bar charts showing video distribution over time periods
  - Recent vs. historical content coverage analysis
  - Publication timeline visualization

- **Update Recommendations**

  - Smart suggestions based on coverage gaps
  - Prioritized recommendations based on content importance
  - API quota-aware update planning

- **Background Collection Tasks**
  - Queue data updates without interrupting analysis
  - Progress monitoring for running tasks
  - Completion notifications and summaries

#### Implementation Details

The coverage analysis component integrates with the data collection pipeline and storage layer to determine what data is available and what's missing. It uses statistical techniques to identify gaps and prioritize recommendations.

```python
# Simplified example of coverage calculation
def calculate_coverage(channel_data):
    total_videos_reported = channel_data['channel_info'].get('statistics', {}).get('videoCount', 0)
    total_videos_collected = len(channel_data.get('videos', []))

    videos_with_comments = sum(1 for video in channel_data.get('videos', [])
                              if video.get('comments', []))

    return {
        'video_coverage_percent': (total_videos_collected / total_videos_reported * 100)
                                   if total_videos_reported > 0 else 0,
        'comment_coverage_percent': (videos_with_comments / total_videos_collected * 100)
                                     if total_videos_collected > 0 else 0
    }
```

### 3. Video Explorer

- **Performance Comparison**
  - Relative performance indicators
  - Outlier identification
  - Top/bottom performers highlighting

#### Implementation Details

The Video Explorer leverages efficient data storage access patterns and Streamlit's data_editor component for interactive browsing. Performance metrics are pre-calculated and cached to ensure responsive user experience.

```python
# Simplified example of video sorting
def sort_videos(videos, sort_by="Published (Newest)"):
    if sort_by == "Published (Newest)":
        return sorted(videos, key=lambda v: v.get('publishedAt', ''), reverse=True)
    elif sort_by == "Views (Highest)":
        return sorted(videos, key=lambda v: v.get('statistics', {}).get('viewCount', 0), reverse=True)
    elif sort_by == "Likes (Highest)":
        return sorted(videos, key=lambda v: v.get('statistics', {}).get('likeCount', 0), reverse=True)
    elif sort_by == "Duration (Longest)":
        return sorted(videos, key=lambda v: parse_duration(v.get('contentDetails', {}).get('duration', 'PT0S')), reverse=True)
    # Additional sort options...
```

#### Implementation Details

The Comment Analysis component utilizes natural language processing techniques for sentiment analysis and topic extraction. It integrates with the data storage layer to access comment data efficiently.

```python
# Simplified example of sentiment analysis
def analyze_comment_sentiment(comments):
    from textblob import TextBlob

    sentiments = []
    for comment in comments:
        text = comment.get('snippet', {}).get('textDisplay', '')
        analysis = TextBlob(text)
        sentiment_score = analysis.sentiment.polarity
        sentiments.append({'comment': text, 'sentiment': sentiment_score})

    return sentiments
```
