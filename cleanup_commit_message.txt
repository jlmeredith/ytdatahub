fix: cleanup temporary debug and fix files

- Moved all temporary debug scripts to archive/fixes
- Moved all fix documentation to archive/fixes or archive/test_docs
- Moved test fix reports to archive/test_docs
- Kept test_issues_tracking.md as it's a permanent documentation file

All unit tests are now passing (100%).
