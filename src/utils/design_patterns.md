# YTDataHub Architectural Patterns

This document defines the standard architectural patterns used in the YTDataHub application. These patterns should be followed consistently throughout the codebase to ensure maintainability and ease onboarding of new developers.

## Factory Pattern

The Factory pattern provides a centralized way to create objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### Implementation Guidelines

```python
class SomeFactory:
    """Factory for creating Some objects."""
    
    @staticmethod
    def create(type_name, config=None):
        """
        Create a Some object of the specified type.
        
        Args:
            type_name (str): The type of object to create
            config (dict, optional): Configuration for the object
            
        Returns:
            Some: An instance of the requested type
        """
        if type_name == "TypeA":
            return TypeA(config)
        elif type_name == "TypeB":
            return TypeB(config)
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown type: {type_name}")
```

### When to Use

- When you need to create objects from a family of related classes
- When you want to hide the specific class implementations from the client code
- When you want to centralize object creation logic

## Service Pattern

The Service pattern encapsulates business logic operations behind a clean interface.

### Implementation Guidelines

```python
class SomeService:
    """Service for handling Some operations."""
    
    def __init__(self, dependencies=None):
        """
        Initialize the service with dependencies.
        
        Args:
            dependencies (object, optional): Dependencies required by the service
        """
        self.dependencies = dependencies or {}
        
    def operation_one(self, input_data):
        """
        Perform operation one.
        
        Args:
            input_data: Data required for the operation
            
        Returns:
            The result of the operation
        """
        # Implementation
        
    def operation_two(self, input_data):
        """
        Perform operation two.
        
        Args:
            input_data: Data required for the operation
            
        Returns:
            The result of the operation
        """
        # Implementation
```

### When to Use

- When you need to encapsulate complex business logic
- When you want to provide a clean API for a related set of operations
- When you need to coordinate multiple lower-level components

## Repository Pattern

The Repository pattern provides an abstraction layer over data storage.

### Implementation Guidelines

```python
class SomeRepository:
    """Repository for Some entities."""
    
    def __init__(self, storage_provider):
        """
        Initialize the repository with a storage provider.
        
        Args:
            storage_provider: The storage backend to use
        """
        self.storage = storage_provider
        
    def get_by_id(self, entity_id):
        """
        Get an entity by ID.
        
        Args:
            entity_id: The ID of the entity to retrieve
            
        Returns:
            The entity or None if not found
        """
        # Implementation
        
    def save(self, entity):
        """
        Save an entity.
        
        Args:
            entity: The entity to save
            
        Returns:
            The saved entity
        """
        # Implementation
        
    def delete(self, entity_id):
        """
        Delete an entity.
        
        Args:
            entity_id: The ID of the entity to delete
            
        Returns:
            True if successful, False otherwise
        """
        # Implementation
```

### When to Use

- When you need to abstract away the details of the data storage
- When you want to centralize data access logic
- When you need to switch between different storage providers

## Analyzer Pattern

The Analyzer pattern processes data to extract insights and metrics.

### Implementation Guidelines

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class BaseAnalyzer(ABC):
    """Base class for analyzers."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize the analyzer."""
        pass
        
    @abstractmethod
    def analyze(self, data):
        """
        Analyze the provided data.
        
        Args:
            data: The data to analyze
            
        Returns:
            The analysis results
        """
        pass
        
    def validate_data(self, data, required_keys=None):
        """
        Validate that the data contains required keys.
        
        Args:
            data: The data to validate
            required_keys: List of required keys
            
        Returns:
            True if valid, False otherwise
        """
        if not data:
            return False
            
        if required_keys:
            return all(key in data for key in required_keys)
            
        return True
        
class SpecificAnalyzer(BaseAnalyzer):
    """Analyzer for specific data."""
    
    def analyze(self, data):
        """
        Analyze specific data.
        
        Args:
            data: The data to analyze
            
        Returns:
            The analysis results
        """
        if not self.validate_data(data, ['required_key']):
            return None
            
        # Perform analysis
        return results
```

### When to Use

- When you need to extract insights from complex data
- When you have multiple related analysis operations to perform
- When you want to provide a consistent interface for analysis operations

## Decorator Pattern

The Decorator pattern adds behavior to objects without affecting other objects of the same class.

### Implementation Guidelines

```python
class Component:
    """Base component interface."""
    
    def operation(self):
        """
        Perform the operation.
        
        Returns:
            The result of the operation
        """
        pass
        
class ConcreteComponent(Component):
    """Concrete implementation of the component."""
    
    def operation(self):
        """
        Perform the operation.
        
        Returns:
            The result of the operation
        """
        return "ConcreteComponent"
        
class Decorator(Component):
    """Base decorator class."""
    
    def __init__(self, component):
        """
        Initialize the decorator with a component.
        
        Args:
            component: The component to decorate
        """
        self._component = component
        
    def operation(self):
        """
        Perform the operation.
        
        Returns:
            The result of the operation
        """
        return self._component.operation()
        
class ConcreteDecoratorA(Decorator):
    """Concrete decorator that adds behavior."""
    
    def operation(self):
        """
        Perform the operation with added behavior.
        
        Returns:
            The result of the operation
        """
        return f"ConcreteDecoratorA({self._component.operation()})"
```

### When to Use

- When you need to add responsibilities to objects dynamically
- When extension by subclassing is impractical
- When you want to add features to individual objects without affecting others

## Adapter Pattern

The Adapter pattern allows interfaces of incompatible classes to work together.

### Implementation Guidelines

```python
class Target:
    """
    The interface that the client expects to work with.
    """
    def request(self):
        """
        Standard request method.
        """
        return "Target: Standard request."
        
class Adaptee:
    """
    Contains useful behavior, but its interface is incompatible
    with the existing client code.
    """
    def specific_request(self):
        """
        Specific request method in the Adaptee's interface.
        """
        return "Adaptee: Specific request."
        
class Adapter(Target):
    """
    Adapts the interface of Adaptee to the Target interface.
    """
    def __init__(self, adaptee):
        """
        Initialize with an Adaptee instance.
        
        Args:
            adaptee: The adaptee to adapt
        """
        self._adaptee = adaptee
        
    def request(self):
        """
        Use the adaptee's method to satisfy the Target interface.
        """
        return f"Adapter: {self._adaptee.specific_request()}"
```

### When to Use

- When you need to use an existing class with an incompatible interface
- When you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated classes
- When you need to integrate with third-party libraries

## Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point to access it.

### Implementation Guidelines

```python
class Singleton:
    """
    A singleton class.
    """
    _instance = None
    
    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        Create a new instance only if one doesn't exist.
        """
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
            # Put initialization here
        return cls._instance
        
    # Or use a class method
    @classmethod
    def get_instance(cls):
        """
        Get the singleton instance.
        """
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = cls()
        return cls._instance
```

### When to Use

- When exactly one instance of a class is needed
- When you need a global point of access to that instance
- When the instance should be lazy-loaded

## Strategy Pattern

The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

### Implementation Guidelines

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Strategy(ABC):
    """
    Base strategy interface.
    """
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self, data):
        """
        Execute the strategy on the data.
        
        Args:
            data: The data to process
            
        Returns:
            The processed data
        """
        pass
        
class ConcreteStrategyA(Strategy):
    """
    Concrete strategy implementation A.
    """
    def execute(self, data):
        """
        Execute strategy A.
        """
        # Implementation for strategy A
        return result
        
class ConcreteStrategyB(Strategy):
    """
    Concrete strategy implementation B.
    """
    def execute(self, data):
        """
        Execute strategy B.
        """
        # Implementation for strategy B
        return result
        
class Context:
    """
    Context that uses a strategy.
    """
    def __init__(self, strategy=None):
        """
        Initialize with a strategy.
        
        Args:
            strategy: The strategy to use
        """
        self._strategy = strategy
        
    def set_strategy(self, strategy):
        """
        Change the strategy at runtime.
        
        Args:
            strategy: The new strategy to use
        """
        self._strategy = strategy
        
    def execute_strategy(self, data):
        """
        Execute the current strategy.
        
        Args:
            data: The data to process
            
        Returns:
            The processed data
        """
        if self._strategy:
            return self._strategy.execute(data)
        return None
```

### When to Use

- When you want to define a family of algorithms
- When you need to switch algorithms at runtime
- When you want to isolate the algorithm from the client that uses it
