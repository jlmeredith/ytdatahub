# GitHub Copilot Instructions: Streamlit Spec-Driven Development

## Core Development Approach

- Follow spec-driven development: implement features according to existing documentation
- Reference project documentation and specifications before implementing any feature
- Separate UI (Streamlit components), business logic, and data processing
- Document public functions with clear docstrings including type hints
- Organize code into modular components with single responsibilities

## Debug and Test File Management

- **IMPORTANT**: Never create debug or test files in the project root
- All debug files must be created in the `./debug/` directory
- All test files must be created in the `./tests/` directory
- Clean up temporary debug files after use
- Include cleanup code in debug scripts to remove generated files
- Use context managers or try/finally blocks to ensure cleanup happens

## Testing Guidelines

- Write tests based on documented specifications
- Use pytest with fixtures to simulate Streamlit context
- Test data processing independently from UI components
- Include edge cases and error handling based on spec requirements
- Use descriptive test names that match specification behaviors

## Project Structure

- Maintain modular organization:
  - src/ (app.py, components/, data/, utils/)
  - tests/ (mirror src/ structure)
  - debug/ (temporary debug scripts and files)
  - data/ (sample datasets)
  - docs/ (specifications and documentation)
- Extract complex UI elements into dedicated component files
- Use st.cache/st.cache_data decorators for performance

## Agent Mode Optimization

- Complete multiple steps with each interaction
- Reference specifications before generating code
- Provide full solutions that align with documented requirements
- Include error handling as specified in documentation
- Anticipate follow-up needs based on project specs

## Code Abstraction Rules

- Refactor any file approaching 1000 lines
- Extract functionality into separate modules when files reach 800+ lines
- Apply Single Responsibility Principle to all modules
- Maintain backward compatibility when abstracting
- Ensure abstractions align with documented architecture

## Streamlit Best Practices

- Separate data loading, processing, and visualization
- Handle all user input validation gracefully
- Provide clear error messages in the UI
- Implement proper state management
- Use appropriate caching for performance

## Coding Standards

- Follow PEP 8 conventions with 88-character line limit
- Use snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes
- Prefer explicit imports over wildcards
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines where possible
- Include type hints for all function parameters and returns

## Cleanup Requirements

- Always include cleanup code for temporary files
- Use pathlib for file operations
- Example cleanup pattern:
  ```python
  from pathlib import Path
  import shutil
  
  debug_dir = Path("./debug")
  # ... debug code ...
  # Cleanup
  if debug_dir.exists():
      shutil.rmtree(debug_dir / "temp_files")
  ```
- Never leave debug artifacts in production code
