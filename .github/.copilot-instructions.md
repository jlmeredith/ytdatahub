### NEVER USE THE TERMINAL TO CREATE OR MODIFY FILES USING HEARDOC
### DO NOT ASK ME TO RUN TERMINAL COMMANDS IF YOU CAN DO SO SAFELY IN PYTHON
### When starting the streamlit server use the command: source /Users/jamiemeredith/Projects/ytdatahub/venv/bin/activate & streamlit run youtube.py --logger.level=debug
# GitHub Copilot Instructions: Streamlit TDD Development

## Core Development Approach

- Follow test-driven development (TDD): write tests first, then implementation
- Use "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle for all features
- Separate UI (Streamlit components), business logic, and data processing
- Document public functions with clear docstrings including type hints
- Organize code into modular components with single responsibilities

## Testing Guidelines

- Write comprehensive tests before implementation
- Use pytest with fixtures to simulate Streamlit context
- Test data processing independently from UI components
- Include edge cases and error handling in test coverage
- Use descriptive test names explaining expected behavior

## Project Structure

- Maintain modular organization:
  - src/ (app.py, components/, data/, utils/)
  - tests/ (mirror src/ structure)
  - data/ (sample datasets)
- Extract complex UI elements into dedicated component files
- Use st.cache/st.cache_data decorators for performance

## Agent Mode Optimization

- Complete multiple steps with each interaction
- Generate both implementation AND test code together
- Provide full solutions rather than skeleton code
- Include error handling and edge case coverage
- Anticipate follow-up needs proactively

## Code Abstraction Rules

- Refactor any file approaching 1000 lines
- Extract functionality into separate modules when files reach 800+ lines
- Apply Single Responsibility Principle to all modules
- Maintain backward compatibility when abstracting
- Test thoroughly after refactoring

## Streamlit Best Practices

- Separate data loading, processing, and visualization
- Handle all user input validation gracefully
- Provide clear error messages in the UI
- Implement proper state management
- Use appropriate caching for performance

## Coding Standards

- Follow PEP 8 conventions with 88-character line limit
- Use snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes
- Prefer explicit imports over wildcards
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines where possible
- Include type hints for all function parameters and returns
