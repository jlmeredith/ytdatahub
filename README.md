# YTDataHub
***Development Note:  This entire application is 100% "vibe" or agentically coded.  I developed the specification and have modified it along the way, but 100% of the code is NOT written by me.  This has been a thought and learning exercise in understanding how to make agentic coding tools do what I want through simple language.  It is actually really great and I hope otherse find it useful once I get to v1.  

The latest code push has the collection system mapping all Youtube public API details to a local database for personal analytics.  The idea behind the project is to create a local system that I can use to surface relevant content. Think advanced Youtube search but taylored to your subscription list.  ***

> **Development Status**: This project is under active development as of May 2025. While most of the core functionality is working, some features may be experimental. A stable release version (1.0) is planned for June 2025.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: Please read [PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md](PROJECT_CONVENTIONS.md) for file organization guidelines and conventions. This helps maintain a clean, organized codebase.

## Codebase Improvements

The codebase has undergone significant refactoring to improve maintainability and performance:

- **Consolidated utilities**: Merged redundant queue management functionality into a single module
- **Removed deprecated code**: Eliminated deprecated utility re-exports and helpers
- **Centralized services**: Created dedicated services for error handling and quota management
- **Optimized imports**: Removed unnecessary imports and moved large dependencies into function scope
- **Enhanced documentation**: Updated documentation to reflect architectural improvements

For more details, see [Refactoring Progress](documentation/reference/source_to_sink_analysis/refactor_progress.md).

## Features

YTDataHub offers a range of features to help you extract and analyze data from YouTube:

### Data Analysis

YTDataHub offers a sophisticated analytics suite with four main components:

- **Analytics Dashboard**: Interactive charts showing channel growth and engagement over time
- **Data Coverage Analysis**: Visual indicators showing data completeness and collection gaps
- **Video Explorer**: Browse, filter, and analyze video performance with customizable views
- **Comment Analysis**: Analyze comment sentiment and discover audience engagement patterns

For detailed information about analytics features, see the [Analytics Features Documentation](documentation/analytics-features.md).

### Data Collection

YTDataHub provides a structured approach to collecting YouTube data:

- **Step-by-step workflow**: Intuitive process for collecting channel, video, and comment data
- **Flexible collection options**: Configure how much data to collect based on your needs
- **Delta reporting**: Track changes between data refreshes to monitor channel growth
- **Bulk import**: Process multiple channels at once with shared collection parameters
- **Comprehensive metadata**: Collect rich information for channels, videos, and comments

For detailed information about data collection, see the [Data Collection Workflow Documentation](documentation/data-collection-workflow.md).

### Data Storage & Organization

YTDataHub ensures your YouTube data is properly stored and easily accessible:

- **Multiple storage options**: Support for SQLite, JSON, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL
- **Enhanced schema**: Rich data model designed for analytical queries
- **Automatic backups**: Prevent data loss with built-in backup functionality
- **Multi-channel storage**: Store data from multiple channels for comparative analysis
- **Data versioning**: Track changes in channel performance over time

## Resetting the Database (Development/Testing)

YTDataHub provides two ways to completely clear and reset your database (all records, all tables):

### 1. Using the UI (Recommended for Most Users)
- Go to the **Utilities** tab in the Streamlit app.
- Scroll to **Database Management Tools**.
- Use the **Clear Database** section:
  - Confirm the warning and type 'CLEAR ALL DATA' to enable the button.
  - Click **Clear Database**. The app will:
    - Create a backup of your current database file (with a timestamp).
    - Drop all tables and recreate the schema.
    - You can immediately start collecting/importing new data.

### 2. Using the CLI (For Automation/Advanced Users)
- Run the following command to clear and reset the database from the terminal:

```bash
venv/bin/python scripts/clear_and_reset_db.py
```
- This will:
  - Create a backup of your database file.
  - Drop all tables and recreate the schema.

**Note:** This operation is destructive and should only be used in development or when you want to start fresh. All data will be lost, but a backup is created for safety.

For more details, see [Database Operations Documentation](documentation/reference/database-operations.md).

### Workflow Parity: Playlist ID Handling

- Both the **New Channel** and **Update Channel** workflows always fetch, log, and store the YouTube uploads playlist ID before any video fetch.
- All playlist ID actions (fetch, store, error) are logged and visible in the UI debug panel.
- This parity is enforced by automated tests and code review to prevent regressions.

## Recent Improvements
